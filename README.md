# Python coded "Alien Invasion" game

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player
shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the alien, a new fleet appears that moves
faster that the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen,
the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

## How to play the game!

To play the game, just go to the green <> Code button and select the zip file to download the project.
Unzip the folder and then open the project in an IDE, I typcally use VS Code.  Once the folder is open, 
open the alien_invasion.py file and run the program.  That should be all that needs to be done!
